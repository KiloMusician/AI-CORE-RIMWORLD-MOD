Implementing collision avoidance for swarm agents in your RimWorld mod involves adding logic to the `UpdateAgent` method in the `SwarmAgent` class to check for potential collisions and adjust the agent's movement accordingly. Here's a simplified guide:

1. **Define a Collision Check Method**: Create a method that checks if a given movement would result in a collision with another agent or an obstacle. This method could take a potential new position as a parameter and return a boolean indicating whether a collision would occur.

```csharp
public bool WouldCollide(IntVec3 newPosition)
{
    // Check for collision with other agents
    foreach (var agent in SwarmIntelligence.Agents)
    {
        if (agent != this && agent.Position == newPosition)
        {
            return true;
        }
    }

    // Check for collision with obstacles
    if (!newPosition.Standable(map))
    {
        return true;
    }

    return false;
}
```

2. **Adjust Movement Based on Collision Check**: In the `UpdateAgent` method, use the collision check method to adjust the agent's movement. If a proposed movement would result in a collision, you could choose a different direction or stay in the current position.

```csharp
public void UpdateAgent()
{
    // Propose a new position
    IntVec3 newPos = Position + GenAdj.AdjacentCellsAndInside.RandomElement();

    // Check for collision
    if (!WouldCollide(newPos))
    {
        // If no collision, move to the new position
        Position = newPos;
    }
    else
    {
        // If collision, choose a different direction or stay in the current position
    }
}
```

Remember, the specifics of your collision avoidance algorithm will depend on the behaviors you want to simulate and the rules you define for your agents.

Implementing dynamic goal-seeking behavior for swarm agents in your RimWorld mod involves adding logic to the `UpdateAgent` method in the `SwarmAgent` class to move towards a goal. Here's a simplified guide:

1. **Define a Goal**: Create a property in the `SwarmAgent` class to represent the agent's goal. This could be a position on the map that the agent is trying to reach.

```csharp
public IntVec3 Goal { get; set; }
```

2. **Define a Method to Move Towards the Goal**: Create a method that updates the agent's position to move towards the goal. This could involve calculating the direction to the goal and taking a step in that direction.

```csharp
public void MoveTowardsGoal()
{
    // Calculate direction to goal
    IntVec3 direction = (Goal - Position).Normalized();

    // Take a step in that direction
    Position += direction;
}
```

3. **Use the Move Towards Goal Method in the Update Agent Method**: In the `UpdateAgent` method, call the `MoveTowardsGoal` method to move the agent towards its goal.

```csharp
public void UpdateAgent()
{
    // Move towards goal
    MoveTowardsGoal();
}
```

4. **Update the Goal Dynamically**: You can update the agent's goal dynamically based on the game state. For example, you could set the goal to the position of a resource when it is discovered, or to the position of a threat when it is detected.

```csharp
public void UpdateAgent()
{
    // Update goal based on game state
    if (resourceDiscovered)
    {
        Goal = resourcePosition;
    }
    else if (threatDetected)
    {
        Goal = threatPosition;
    }

    // Move towards goal
    MoveTowardsGoal();
}
```

Remember, the specifics of your goal-seeking behavior will depend on the behaviors you want to simulate and the rules you define for your agents.
