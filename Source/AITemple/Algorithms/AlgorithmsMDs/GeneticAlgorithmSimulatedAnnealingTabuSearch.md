Implementing a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with Simulated Annealing (SA) and Tabu Search (TS) in your RimWorld mod involves several steps. Here's a simplified example of how you might structure a GA with SA and TS in C#:

1. **Define the individual**: An individual represents a potential solution to the problem you're trying to solve. In a game like RimWorld, an individual might represent a strategy for resource allocation, character behavior, or base layout.

```csharp
public class Individual
{
    // Define the properties of the individual here
}
```

2. **Initialize a population**: Create a random population of individuals to start the GA.

```csharp
private List<Individual> InitializePopulation(int populationSize)
{
    List<Individual> population = new List<Individual>();
    for (int i = 0; i < populationSize; i++)
    {
        population.Add(new Individual()); // Initialize a new individual
    }
    return population;
}
```

3. **Define a fitness function**: This function evaluates how good a solution (individual) is. The fitness function depends on the problem you're trying to solve.

```csharp
private double Evaluate(Individual individual)
{
    double score = 0;
    // Calculate the score based on your problem
    return score;
}
```

4. **Define the selection, crossover, and mutation operations**: These operations are used to generate new individuals for the next generation.

```csharp
private Individual Select(List<Individual> population)
{
    // Implement a selection method here, such as roulette wheel selection or tournament selection
}

private Individual Crossover(Individual parent1, Individual parent2)
{
    // Implement a crossover method here, such as one-point crossover or uniform crossover
}

private void Mutate(Individual individual)
{
    // Implement a mutation method here, such as bit flip mutation or swap mutation
}
```

5. **Main loop of the GA**: The main loop of the GA generates a new population, evaluates the individuals, and selects the best individuals for the next generation.

```csharp
public void RunGeneticAlgorithm(int populationSize, int generations)
{
    List<Individual> population = InitializePopulation(populationSize);
    for (int i = 0; i < generations; i++)
    {
        List<Individual> newPopulation = new List<Individual>();
        for (int j = 0; j < populationSize; j++)
        {
            Individual parent1 = Select(population);
            Individual parent2 = Select(population);
            Individual offspring = Crossover(parent1, parent2);
            Mutate(offspring);
            newPopulation.Add(offspring);
        }
        population = newPopulation;
    }
}
```

6. **Integrate SA and TS into the GA**: You can integrate SA and TS into the GA by using them to optimize the individuals in the population. After generating the new population in the GA, you can run the SA on each individual to further optimize them. Then, you can use TS to avoid getting stuck in local optima.

```csharp
public void RunGeneticAlgorithmWithSimulatedAnnealingAndTabuSearch(int populationSize, int generations, int saIterations, int tabuListSize)
{
    List<Individual> population = InitializePopulation(populationSize);
    List<Individual> tabuList = new List<Individual>();
    for (int i = 0; i < generations; i++)
    {
        List<Individual> newPopulation = new List<Individual>();
        for (int j = 0; j < populationSize; j++)
        {
            Individual parent1 = Select(population);
            Individual parent2 = Select(population);
            Individual offspring = Crossover(parent1, parent2);
            Mutate(offspring);
            SimulatedAnnealing(offspring, saIterations); // Run SA on the offspring
            if (tabuList.Contains(offspring))
            {
                continue; // Skip this offspring if it's in the tabu list
            }
            if (tabuList.Count >= tabuListSize)
            {
                tabuList.RemoveAt(0); // Remove the oldest individual
            }
            tabuList.Add(offspring); // Add the offspring to the tabu list
            newPopulation.Add(offspring);
        }
        population = newPopulation;
    }
}
```

The `SimulatedAnnealing` function is similar to the `Optimize` function in the SA algorithm. It generates a neighbor of the current individual, decides whether to move to the neighbor based on the fitness and the temperature, and updates the temperature.

Remember to adjust the parameters and the `Evaluate`, `Select`, `Crossover`, `Mutate`, `SimulatedAnnealing`, and `RunGeneticAlgorithmWithSimulatedAnnealingAndTabuSearch` methods to suit your specific needs. The parameters of the GA, SA, and TS algorithms (population size, number of generations, mutation rate, initial temperature, cooling rate, tabu list size) and the fitness function can greatly affect the algorithm's performance and the quality of the solutions it finds.
