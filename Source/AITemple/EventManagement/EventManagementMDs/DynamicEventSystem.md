The provided C# code is part of a RimWorld mod and is contained within the `DynamicEventSystem` class in the `OldestHouse.AITemple` namespace. This class is responsible for handling different types of game events.

The `HandleEvent` method is the main event handler in this class. It takes a `GameEvent` object as a parameter and uses a switch statement to handle different types of events. If the event type is `WeatherChange`, it calls the `ReactToWeather` method, passing the event details. If the event type is `Raid`, it calls the `PrepareForRaid` method, also passing the event details. If the event type is not handled, it logs an "Unhandled event type" message.

The `ReactToWeather` method is used to adjust colonist activities based on the weather. In this case, if the weather details contain the word "storm", it would move the colonists to safety. However, the actual implementation of this logic is not shown in the provided code.

The `PrepareForRaid` method is used to organize the defense when a raid event occurs. The actual implementation of this logic is also not shown in the provided code. In a complete implementation, you would likely use the raid details to determine the severity of the raid and adjust your defense strategy accordingly.
