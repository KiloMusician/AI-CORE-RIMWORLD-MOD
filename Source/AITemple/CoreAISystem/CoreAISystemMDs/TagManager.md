The provided C# code is part of the `RimWorldAdvancedAIMod.AI` namespace and defines two classes: `TagManager` and `SuperMegaHyperTag`.

The `SuperMegaHyperTag` class is a simple data structure that represents a complex tag with multiple attributes. It has two properties: `TagName` of type `string` and `Attributes` of type `Dictionary<string, string>`. The `Attributes` dictionary is initialized in the constructor of `SuperMegaHyperTag`.

The `TagManager` class is responsible for managing these complex tags. It maintains a private dictionary `tags` that maps a string (the tag name) to a `SuperMegaHyperTag` object.

The `TagManager` constructor initializes the `tags` dictionary and calls the `InitializeDefaultTags` method, which sets up an initial complex tag as an example.

The `UpdateTag` method is used to add a new tag or update an existing one. If the tag already exists, it merges the new attributes with the existing ones. If the tag does not exist, it creates a new `SuperMegaHyperTag` object and adds it to the `tags` dictionary.

The `RemoveTag` method removes a tag from the `tags` dictionary and returns a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful.

The `GetFormattedTagInfo` method retrieves a tag from the `tags` dictionary and returns a formatted string containing the tag name and its attributes. If the tag is not found, it returns a "Tag not found." message.
