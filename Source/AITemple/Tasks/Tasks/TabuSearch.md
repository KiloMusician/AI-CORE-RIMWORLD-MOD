Implementing a Tabu Search (TS) algorithm in your RimWorld mod involves several steps. Here's a simplified example of how you might structure a TS in C#:

1. **Define the state**: A state represents a potential solution to the problem you're trying to solve. In a game like RimWorld, a state might represent a strategy for resource allocation, character behavior, or base layout.

```csharp
public class State
{
    // Define the properties of the state here
}
```

2. **Initialize a state**: Create a random state to start the TS.

```csharp
private State InitializeState()
{
    State state = new State(); // Initialize a new state
    return state;
}
```

3. **Define a fitness function**: This function evaluates how good a solution (state) is. The fitness function depends on the problem you're trying to solve.

```csharp
private double Evaluate(State state)
{
    double score = 0;
    // Calculate the score based on your problem
    return score;
}
```

4. **Define a neighbor function**: This function generates a state that is a small random variation of the current state.

```csharp
private State GenerateNeighbor(State currentState)
{
    State neighbor = new State(); // Generate a neighbor of the current state
    return neighbor;
}
```

5. **Define the tabu list**: The tabu list stores the recent moves that are forbidden. You can use a simple list or a more complex data structure depending on your needs.

```csharp
private List<State> tabuList = new List<State>();
```

6. **Main loop**: The main loop of the TS algorithm generates a neighbor, checks if it is in the tabu list, decides whether to move to the neighbor based on the fitness, and updates the tabu list.

```csharp
public void Optimize(int iterations, int tabuListSize)
{
    State currentState = InitializeState();
    double currentScore = Evaluate(currentState);
    for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++)
    {
        State neighbor = GenerateNeighbor(currentState);
        double neighborScore = Evaluate(neighbor);
        if (!tabuList.Contains(neighbor) && (tabuList.Count == 0 || neighborScore < currentScore))
        {
            currentState = neighbor;
            currentScore = neighborScore;
            if (tabuList.Count >= tabuListSize)
            {
                tabuList.RemoveAt(0); // Remove the oldest state
            }
            tabuList.Add(currentState); // Add the current state to the tabu list
        }
    }
}
```

Remember to adjust the parameters and the `Evaluate`, `GenerateNeighbor`, and `Optimize` methods to suit your specific needs. The parameters of the TS algorithm (number of iterations, tabu list size) and the fitness function can greatly affect the algorithm's performance and the quality of the solutions it finds.
