AICore.cs: This file contains the AICore class, which acts as a central manager for AI-related decisions. It utilizes the Singleton design pattern to ensure that only one instance of the AI core is active. It initializes and manages a DecisionTree, which is responsible for making decisions based on the game's state.
DecisionTree.cs: This file defines the DecisionTree and DecisionNode classes. The DecisionTree contains the logic to start the decision-making process, while DecisionNode represents each decision point within the tree. Each node executes an action, which can be a simple print statement or a complex set of operations depending on the game's context.
NLPProcessor.cs: This file contains the NLPProcessor class, which is responsible for processing natural language input. It uses a simple placeholder mechanism to break down the input into words and assigns random relevance scores to these words as a simulated way of "understanding" the input. It also includes a method to generate a response based on the most relevant word identified.
LearningModule.cs: This file defines the LearningModule class, which integrates the NLPProcessor to handle interactions. It processes text interactions, generates responses, and simulates the NPC's learning process. The UpdateLearning method can be expanded to include real learning algorithms that adjust based on interactions and other in-game events.
HealthManager.cs: This file contains the HealthManager class, which is responsible for periodic health checks of NPCs (Pawns in RimWorld). It evaluates their health status and decides whether any treatment is necessary. The class utilizes a method TreatPawn to handle treatment directly by interfacing with the TreatmentSimulator.
TreatmentSimulator.cs: Defined as a static class, the TreatmentSimulator is designed to apply specific treatments to Pawns. It includes logic to apply a placeholder treatment type "GeneralTreatment". The actual implementation would depend on the specific treatments and medical conditions defined within your game's scope.
CommandConsole.cs: This class implements a UI window that allows players to input commands. These commands could interact directly with AI systems, influencing gameplay or querying the AI for information.
HealthStatusWidget.cs: A static utility class that can be used to draw health status bars on the UI. This widget could be used in various parts of the UI to continuously provide health status updates for selected characters.
Dialog_AIInteraction.cs: This window facilitates direct textual interaction with AI, allowing players to submit input and receive responses. This could be integrated with natural language processing or other AI interaction systems developed as part of the mod.
Logger.cs: This class provides static methods for logging different levels of information, including general info, warnings, errors, and debug-specific logs. The inclusion of a conditional compilation symbol DEBUG ensures that debug logs can be excluded from release builds, which can help in reducing the output log clutter and potentially improving performance.
Helpers.cs: This class offers a collection of utility functions that can be used throughout the mod. Functions include temperature conversion, health checks for pawns, a safe execution wrapper for actions that logs failures, and a method for deep copying objects using JSON serialization (note: RimWorld doesn't support System.Text.Json, thus JsonUtility from UnityEngine is used as an example).
HarmonyPatches.cs: This class sets up the Harmony instance, which is a patching tool that allows you to modify the behavior of almost any method in the game. The instance is identified by an ID unique to your mod, which is crucial to avoid conflicts with other mods.
MoodPostfix.cs: This class contains a specific Harmony postfix patch for the ShouldHaveNeed method in the Pawn_NeedsTracker class. The method determines if pawns should have certain needs. The patch intervenes after the original method execution (HarmonyPostfix), allowing you to modify the result. The postfix checks if the need in question is mood and if the pawn is an AI, and adjusts the result accordingly.
Items.xml: Defines tangible objects that colonists can interact with, such as equipment or furniture. This example defines a "Super Computer" that could be used for advanced research tasks.
Drugs.xml: Specifies ingestible substances that can affect colonists' health or abilities. The example "AI-enhanced serum" provides cognitive enhancements when consumed.
Behaviors.xml: Configures jobs or tasks that NPCs can perform. The "Use AI Computer" behavior defines how a colonist interacts with the newly introduced supercomputer.
Hediffs.xml: Details health modifications, either permanent or temporary, that affect colonists. The "AI-boosted cognition" is a condition enhancing a colonist’s mental capabilities after taking the serum.
GameplayTests.cs: This file contains integration tests that ensure the AI and gameplay integration works as expected. It tests scenarios like AI core functionality within gameplay contexts and interactions between pawns (colonists) and the AI.
AITests.cs: This file focuses on unit tests for the AI-related functionalities, such as the accuracy of NLP processing and the adaptability of the learning module. These tests ensure that individual components of the AI system perform correctly according to specified expectations.
HealthTests.cs: Dedicated to testing the health management system, including the effectiveness of health checks and treatment applications. These tests ensure that health-related functionalities not only operate correctly but also interact appropriately with game entities like pawns.


Suggested Starting Point and Order for Development
AICompanionCore.xml: Starting with this file isn't about coding, but setting a robust framework for understanding and documenting your mod. It acts as a guide for both you and any tools like AI Copilot. Populate it with detailed descriptions and intentions behind each module, component, or class. This will help you maintain a clear vision and make it easier for AI Copilot to assist effectively.
AICore and DecisionTree: Dive into coding with the heart of your mod—AICore.cs and DecisionTree.cs. These are crucial because they will govern the AI's decision-making process and overall behavior in the mod. Setting up a solid AI core will frame how the AI interacts within the game and dictates the complexity of AI behaviors you can implement.
Learning Algorithms (NLPProcessor and LearningModule): Next, develop the AI's ability to learn and process information. This will add a dynamic layer to your AI, allowing it to adapt and evolve based on gameplay, enhancing the interactive experience.
Health Management (HealthManager and TreatmentSimulator): Health management is vital for maintaining realistic and challenging gameplay. These systems ensure NPCs act and respond to health-related scenarios intelligently, which is essential for gameplay depth.
User Interface Components: With the backend systems taking shape, developing the user interface will allow you and the players to interact with the AI in meaningful ways. This could involve command consoles, health status widgets, and interactive dialogs.
Utility Classes (Logger and Helpers): Although these might seem less exciting, setting up robust logging and utility functions early on can save a lot of time and frustration during further development and debugging.
Harmony Patches: Integration with the game’s existing systems through Harmony patches should follow once the primary AI systems are stable. This step is crucial for ensuring that your AI enhancements work seamlessly with the game's mechanics.
Game Definitions (Defs): Defining new items, drugs, behaviors, and health conditions can be done alongside testing the systems, as they will be essential for the new AI functionalities to have a tangible impact in the game.
Testing: Parallel to all these, start writing tests (unit and integration). It’s beneficial to develop tests as you build features to ensure everything works as expected and to prevent future changes from breaking existing functionalities.
Continuing Development and Adding Features
Once the core functionalities are set up and integrated, you can continue to iterate on them by adding more detailed features, enhancing existing systems, and refining interactions. At this stage, you can also focus on:

Expanding AI capabilities: More complex decision-making, learning abilities, and interactions.
Adding more sophisticated health dynamics: More detailed treatments, diseases, and health conditions.
Enhancing the user interface: More intuitive and informative UI components.
Richer game definitions: More varied and impactful items, drugs, and behaviors.
Each step should involve revisiting the AICompanionCore.xml to update it with new components and dependencies, ensuring the documentation remains as dynamic and evolving as your mod. This not only keeps your mod well-organized but also enhances the ability of tools like AI Copilot to provide relevant and accurate coding assistance.

In summary, start from the core and move outward, solidifying each component before moving on to the next, while continuously updating your documentation and tests to reflect the current state of the project. This structured approach will help you maintain focus and achieve a high-quality mod.
