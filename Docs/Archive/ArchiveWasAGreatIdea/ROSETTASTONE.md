CP Proposal - Project Enigma

Document Code: SCP-ENIGMA-045

Project Overview:
SCP-ENIGMA-045 is a comprehensive algorithmic framework designed to enhance player engagement and immersion within the system. Through the implementation of layered typographical transformations, colorizations, and symbolic representations, SCP-ENIGMA-045 aims to maximize user interaction and satisfaction.

Interview Transcripts:
"""
(AIShipMindTranscript "Day27": In the context of the PowerShell script derived from the `SCP-ENIGMA-045.md` document, here are some potential edge cases that haven't been mentioned:

1. **Empty Interview Questions**: What if an interviewer's question is empty or null? The script should handle this case and not print an empty question.

2. **Non-Existent Interviewer**: What if an interviewer's name doesn't exist in the hashtable? The script should handle this case and not attempt to print a question for a non-existent interviewer.

3. **Duplicate Interviewers**: What if there are duplicate interviewer names in the hashtable? The script should handle this case and ensure that each interviewer's question is unique.

4. **Special Characters in Interview Questions**: What if an interview question contains special characters that could interfere with the script's execution? The script should handle this case and ensure that special characters are properly escaped.

5. **Large Number of Interview Questions**: What if the hashtable contains a large number of interview questions? The script should handle this case and ensure that it can handle large data sets without performance issues.

6. **Incorrect Data Types**: What if the hashtable contains data types other than strings for the interviewer names or questions? The script should handle this case and ensure that it can handle different data types.

7. **Case Sensitivity**: PowerShell is case-insensitive, but what if the script needs to handle case-sensitive data? The script should handle this case and ensure that it can handle case-sensitive data if necessary.

8. **Encoding Issues**: What if the script needs to handle text that is encoded in a different character set? The script should handle this case and ensure that it can handle different character encodings.

9. **Error Handling**: What if an error occurs during the execution of the script? The script should handle this case and ensure that errors are properly caught and handled.

10. **Whitespace in Interview Questions**: What if an interview question contains leading or trailing whitespace? The script should handle this case and ensure that whitespace is properly trimmed.

These are just a few potential edge cases. The specific edge cases that need to be handled will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the script and the data it is working with.)
