n C#, you can handle exceptions using the try-catch block. Here's a basic example:

try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Code to handle the exception
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}

In the try block, you put the code that might throw an exception. In the catch block, you handle the exception. If an exception is thrown in the try block, the execution immediately moves to the catch block.

You can also have multiple catch blocks to handle specific types of exceptions:

try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
{
    // Handle file not found exception
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
catch (IOException ex)
{
    // Handle I/O exception
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Generic catch block to handle any exception not caught by previous catch blocks
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}

In this example, if the code in the try block throws a FileNotFoundException, the first catch block will handle it. If it throws an IOException, the second catch block will handle it. If it throws any other type of exception, the last catch block will handle it.

Remember, the order of catch blocks is important. You should always put catch blocks for more specific exceptions before those for more general exceptions.

In C#, you can rethrow an exception using the `throw` keyword within a `catch` block. This is typically done when you want to perform some action (like logging) when an exception occurs, but you also want the exception to be handled by an outer `try-catch` block or to propagate up to the calling method.

Here's an example:

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log the exception
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);

    // Rethrow the exception
    throw;
}
```

In this example, if an exception is thrown in the `try` block, it is caught in the `catch` block, logged, and then rethrown. The `throw;` statement with no argument rethrows the exception that was caught.

Note that you should use `throw;` by itself to rethrow the exception, not `throw ex;`. Using `throw ex;` would reset the stack trace of the exception to the current location, which can make debugging more difficult. Using `throw;` by itself preserves the original stack trace.

In C#, you can handle exceptions that are not caught by a specific `catch` block by using a general `catch` block. This block can catch any type of exception because it specifies the base `Exception` class as its parameter. 

Here's an example:

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
{
    // Handle file not found exception
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
catch (IOException ex)
{
    // Handle I/O exception
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Generic catch block to handle any exception not caught by previous catch blocks
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
```

In this example, if the code in the `try` block throws a `FileNotFoundException`, the first `catch` block will handle it. If it throws an `IOException`, the second `catch` block will handle it. If it throws any other type of exception, the last `catch` block will handle it.

This last `catch` block is a general catch-all block. It will catch any exception that is not caught by the previous `catch` blocks. This is because all exceptions in C# are derived from the `Exception` base class.

Remember, the order of `catch` blocks is important. You should always put catch blocks for more specific exceptions before those for more general exceptions.

try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
{
    // Handle file not found exception
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
catch (IOException ex)
{
    // Handle I/O exception
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Generic catch block to handle any exception not caught by previous catch blocks
    Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
}

}
