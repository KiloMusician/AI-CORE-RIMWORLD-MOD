This XML code is a configuration file for NLog, a flexible and widely used logging platform for .NET applications. The configuration file is used to control how logging behaves in an application.

The root element of the document is `<nlog>`, which contains two child elements: `<targets>` and `<rules>`.

The `<targets>` element is where you define where the logs should be written. In this case, two targets are defined: a `Console` target and a `File` target. The `Console` target writes logs to the console, and the `File` target writes logs to a file named `log.txt`.

Both targets use the same layout for their log messages: `${longdate} ${level} ${message}  ${exception}`. This layout includes the date and time of the log (`${longdate}`), the log level (`${level}`), the log message (`${message}`), and any exception information (`${exception}`).

The `<rules>` element is where you define which logs should be written to which targets. In this case, a single rule is defined for all loggers (`name="*"`). This rule states that any logs with a level of `Info` or higher should be written to both the `console` and `file` targets (`writeTo="console, file"`).

In summary, this NLog configuration file is set up to write all `Info` level (and higher) logs to both the console and a file, using a specific layout for the log messages.
