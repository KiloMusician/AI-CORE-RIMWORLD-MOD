To access the recent events logged in the `VirtualMap` class, you would need to have a method or property in the `VirtualMap` class that exposes these events. 

If such a method or property doesn't exist, you would need to modify the `VirtualMap` class to include one. Here's an example of how you might do this:

```csharp
public class VirtualMap
{
    private List<string> eventLog = new List<string>();

    public void LogEvent(string eventInfo)
    {
        eventLog.Add(eventInfo);
    }

    public List<string> GetRecentEvents(int numberOfEvents)
    {
        return eventLog.TakeLast(numberOfEvents).ToList();
    }
}
```

In this example, `LogEvent` is used to log events, and `GetRecentEvents` is used to retrieve the most recent events. You can then use `GetRecentEvents` in your simulation code like so:

```csharp
public static async Task StartSimulation(int maxCycles = 10)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < maxCycles; i++)
    {
        var virtualMap = InitializeVirtualMap();
        LogMessage("Virtual environment initialized.");

        DateTime endTime = DateTime.Now.AddHours(2);
        while (DateTime.Now < endTime)
        {
            await SimulateDay(virtualMap);
            LogDayEvents(virtualMap);
            AdjustSimulationSettings();
        }

        var recentEvents = virtualMap.GetRecentEvents(5);
        foreach (var eventInfo in recentEvents)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(eventInfo);
        }

        LogMessage("Simulation cycle completed. Restarting...");
    }
}
```

This will print the 5 most recent events at the end of each simulation cycle. Adjust the number passed to `GetRecentEvents` as needed.

public class VirtualMap
{
    private List<string> eventLog = new List<string>();

    public void LogEvent(string eventInfo)
    {
        eventLog.Add(eventInfo);
    }

    public List<string> GetRecentEvents(int numberOfEvents)
    {
        return eventLog.TakeLast(numberOfEvents).ToList();
    }
}

In this example, LogEvent is used to log events, and GetRecentEvents is used to retrieve the most recent events. You can then use GetRecentEvents in your simulation code like so:

public static async Task StartSimulation(int maxCycles = 10)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < maxCycles; i++)
    {
        var virtualMap = InitializeVirtualMap();
        LogMessage("Virtual environment initialized.");

        DateTime endTime = DateTime.Now.AddHours(2);
        while (DateTime.Now < endTime)
        {
            await SimulateDay(virtualMap);
            LogDayEvents(virtualMap);
            AdjustSimulationSettings();
        }

        var recentEvents = virtualMap.GetRecentEvents(5);
        foreach (var eventInfo in recentEvents)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(eventInfo);
        }

        LogMessage("Simulation cycle completed. Restarting...");
    }
}

This will print the 5 most recent events at the end of each simulation cycle. Adjust the number passed to GetRecentEvents as needed.

The AdjustSimulationSettings method in your code is already designed to reduce CPU usage when it exceeds 50%. It does this by calling PerformanceMetrics.ReduceSimulationLoad().

private static void AdjustSimulationSettings()
{
    if (PerformanceMetrics.CurrentCPUUsage > 50.0)
    {
        PerformanceMetrics.ReduceSimulationLoad();
        LogMessage("Adjusting simulation settings for optimal performance.");
    }
}

If you want to reduce CPU usage further, you could consider the following options:

Lower the CPU usage threshold: Currently, the simulation only adjusts its settings when CPU usage exceeds 50%. You could lower this threshold to reduce CPU usage more aggressively.

if (PerformanceMetrics.CurrentCPUUsage > 30.0) // Lower threshold
{
    PerformanceMetrics.ReduceSimulationLoad();
    LogMessage("Adjusting simulation settings for optimal performance.");
}

Optimize the SimulateDay method: If the SimulateDay method is CPU-intensive, optimizing it could help reduce CPU usage. Without knowing what SimulationEngine.ProcessDayEvents(map) does, it's hard to give specific advice, but general strategies include reducing the complexity of the computations, avoiding unnecessary work, and using more efficient data structures.

Increase the delay in SimulateDay: The SimulateDay method currently waits for 1 second (await Task.Delay(1000)) between each day in the simulation. Increasing this delay would reduce the frequency of the computations, thereby reducing CPU usage.

await Task.Delay(2000); // Increase delay

Remember, these are just suggestions. The best approach depends on the specifics of your simulation and the performance requirements of your application.

To access the population and resources in the `VirtualMap` class, you would need to use the `Population` and `Resources` properties of an instance of the `VirtualMap` class. 

Here's an example of how you might do this:

```csharp
public static void DisplayMapInfo(VirtualMap map)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Population: {map.Population}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Wood: {map.Resources.Wood}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Steel: {map.Resources.Steel}");
}
```

In this example, `DisplayMapInfo` is a method that takes an instance of `VirtualMap` as a parameter and prints the population and resources (wood and steel) to the console. 

You can call this method in your simulation code like so:

```csharp
public static async Task StartSimulation(int maxCycles = 10)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < maxCycles; i++)
    {
        var virtualMap = InitializeVirtualMap();
        LogMessage("Virtual environment initialized.");

        DisplayMapInfo(virtualMap); // Display map info

        DateTime endTime = DateTime.Now.AddHours(2);
        while (DateTime.Now < endTime)
        {
            await SimulateDay(virtualMap);
            LogDayEvents(virtualMap);
            AdjustSimulationSettings();
        }

        LogMessage("Simulation cycle completed. Restarting...");
    }
}
```

This will print the population and resources at the start of each simulation cycle.

To add a new event to the recent events log in the VirtualMap class, you would need to have a method in the VirtualMap class that allows you to add events.

If such a method doesn't exist, you would need to modify the VirtualMap class to include one. Here's an example of how you might do this:

public class VirtualMap
{
    private List<GameEvent> eventLog = new List<GameEvent>();

    public void LogEvent(GameEvent gameEvent)
    {
        eventLog.Add(gameEvent);
    }

    public List<GameEvent> RecentEvents
    {
        get { return eventLog; }
    }
}

In this example, LogEvent is used to log events, and RecentEvents is a property that exposes the event log.

You can then use LogEvent in your simulation code like so:

public static async Task StartSimulation(int maxCycles = 10)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < maxCycles; i++)
    {
        var virtualMap = InitializeVirtualMap();
        LogMessage("Virtual environment initialized.");

        // Create a new event
        var gameEvent = new GameEvent { Description = "Simulation started." };
        // Add the event to the log
        virtualMap.LogEvent(gameEvent);

        DateTime endTime = DateTime.Now.AddHours(2);
        while (DateTime.Now < endTime)
        {
            await SimulateDay(virtualMap);
            LogDayEvents(virtualMap);
            AdjustSimulationSettings();
        }

        LogMessage("Simulation cycle completed. Restarting...");
    }
}

This will add a new event to the log at the start of each simulation cycle. Adjust the GameEvent creation as needed.

To access the weather information in the VirtualMap class, you would need to use the Weather property of an instance of the VirtualMap class.

Here's an example of how you might do this:

public static void DisplayWeatherInfo(VirtualMap map)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Current Weather: {map.Weather}");
}

In this example, DisplayWeatherInfo is a method that takes an instance of VirtualMap as a parameter and prints the current weather to the console.

You can call this method in your simulation code like so:

public static async Task StartSimulation(int maxCycles = 10)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < maxCycles; i++)
    {
        var virtualMap = InitializeVirtualMap();
        LogMessage("Virtual environment initialized.");

        DisplayWeatherInfo(virtualMap); // Display weather info

        DateTime endTime = DateTime.Now.AddHours(2);
        while (DateTime.Now < endTime)
        {
            await SimulateDay(virtualMap);
            LogDayEvents(virtualMap);
            AdjustSimulationSettings();
        }

        LogMessage("Simulation cycle completed. Restarting...");
    }
}

This will print the current weather at the start of each simulation cycle.
